# Weather App

The Weather App is a dynamic web application that provides real-time weather forecasts using the Visual Crossing API. This project allows users to search for weather data by location and toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The app dynamically updates its appearance based on the weather conditions, enhancing the user experience with visual cues like background color changes and weather-related images. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project demonstrates the integration of APIs, asynchronous programming using promises and async/await, and DOM manipulation to present data in a user-friendly manner.

Key features include a responsive interface that fetches and displays current weather conditions and a 10-day forecast. The app is designed with interactive components, such as a location input dialog and a toggle button to switch temperature units. The project also emphasizes best practices in API usage, including error handling and security considerations. Overall, this project involved wokring with external APIs, managing asynchronous data flows, and creating engaging and intuitive web applications that respond to user inputs in real-time.
